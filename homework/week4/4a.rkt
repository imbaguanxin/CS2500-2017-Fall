;; Exercise 5
;; Purpose of Programe
;; Design a Finite State Machine to exam user's input
;; Its state changes according to user's input
;; Change of state:
;; START: havenâ€™t seen any part of "good" yet
;; G: have seen the intial "g"
;; O1: have seen at least one "o"
;; O2: have seen at least two "o"s
;; D: have seen the final "d"

;; Finite-State-Machine is the main function
;; it changes the world color according to user input
;; The initial value of the world is "white"
;; A world is a string that stands for the color of rectangles
;; String -> String
