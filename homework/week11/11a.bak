; Exercise1
; A Road is one of:
; - 'dead-end
; - (make-straightaway String PositiveNumber Road)
; - Intersection
 
(define-struct straightaway [name distance more])
; INTERPRETATION: A road with some name and some amount of distance
; until the next portion of road
 
; An Intersection is a [List-of Road]

; examples:
(define r0 'dead-end)
(define r1 ("1" 10 r0))
(define r2 ("2" 15 r1))
(define r3 ("3" 21 r2))

; total-road-length: straightaway
(define (total-road-length r)
  (local
    [(define (calculate-straightaway sw)
      (+ (straightaway-distance sw) (total-road-length (straightaway-more sw))))
