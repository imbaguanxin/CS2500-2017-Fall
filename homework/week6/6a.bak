(define-struct contact [name phone])
; A Contact is a (make-contact String Number)
 
; An AddressBook is one of:
; - '()
; - (cons Contact AddressBook)
; INTERPRETATION: A list of contacts, with their names and addresses
; template:
#;(define (AddressBook-temp add)
    (cond
      [(empty? add)...]
      [(cons? add) ...(first add)...
                   ...(AddressBook-temp (rest add))...]))
 
; A MaybeNumber is one of
; - #false
; - Number
; INTERPRETATION: Represents maybe having a number
; template:
#;(define (MaybeNumber-temp MN)
    (cond
      [(boolean? MN)...]
      [(number? MN)...]))

; String, AddressBook -> MaybeNumber
; find-contact:
; accepts a String representing the name of a contact
; and an AddressBook, and returns a MaybeNumber: either
; the first Number in the AddressBook for a Contact
; with that name, or if such a contact does not exist,
; find-contact should return #false
